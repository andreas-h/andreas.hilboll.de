There is actually some buzz around [Gnome 3][gnome3]
and the new release of Ubuntu switching to [Unity][unity]. I thought
this was a good occasion to make this small post to tell that I still
uses [FVWM][fvwm] whose latest version was released a month ago.

[unity]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unity_%28desktop_environment%29
[fvwm]: http://www.fvwm.org/
[fvwm261]: http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.comp.window-managers.fvwm.announce/31

FVWM is a very old window manager. So old that nobody really knows
what the *F* stands for. It comes with a ugly configuration by default
and can be configured to [look even uglier][ugly]. However, FVWM is
powerful and highly configurable. Moreover, it is pretty lightweight.

# My FVWM configuration

My [configuration of FVWM][config] is available on GitHub. It requires
the use of `fvwm-crystal`. If you are running Debian or Ubuntu, there
is a package for this. This is a set of powerful configuration files
for FVWM which add a lot of goodies and themes. Unfortunately, the
project site seems to have disappared. You can still grab the
[sources from your nearest Debian mirror][sources].

[config]: https://github.com/vincentbernat/fvwm-configuration
[sources]: http://ftp.de.debian.org/debian/pool/main/f/fvwm-crystal/fvwm-crystal_3.0.5.dfsg.orig.tar.gz

While those configuration files were great, I did not like to have
such a complex desktop with all those icons and menus. However, what
is great with _fvwm-crystal_ is you can overlay your own
configuration. If a file is present in your home directory, it will
take precedence over the one installed on the system. So, I just wrote
a new recipe.

What you may want to steal from my configuration is the ability to
alter the configuration depending on the fact that you are using one
or two screens. With one screen, you get:

 * an application panel (a launcher bar) on the upper left corner,
 * an icon manager (which will contained iconified windows) on the
   upper right corner,
 * a systray on the left of the icon manager
 * a pager (which shows various desktops) just below it,
 * two icon managers (which act as a taskbar) on the bottom, one for
   regular applications and the other one for terminal windows.

With two screens, the organization is different. The two icon managers
at the bottom are on their own screens. The pager is between the two
screens and the other elements are on the upper left of the right
screen.

If I am using a single screen and I plug another one, I do something
like this to get my setup updated:

    ::console
    $ xrandr --output  VGA-1 --auto --output DVI-I-1 --auto --right-of VGA-1
    $ killall trayer ; FvwmCommand Restart

I also uses [conky][conky], a light-weight system monitor. It is
started in my `.xsession`, not through FVWM.

# Building wallpapers for dual-screen

One difficulty with a multi-head setup is "how to get the background
set properly?". I have made a
[small script for generating one][wallpaper]. Use it like this:

    ::console
    $ ./build-wallpaper.py -d ~/.fvwm/wallpapers -c -t ~/tmp/mywallpaper.png

It will randomly select two wallpapers and put them together to look
nice on your dual-screen setup. It will also correct the aspect ratio,
either by cropping the image or centering the image.

You need the following dependencies to make script work: `python-xpyb`
and `python-imaging`.

**UPDATED:** [Thomas Adam][tweet1] pointed to [Nitrogen][nitrogen], a
graphical wallpaper utility supporting multi-head setups. It is a
great tool if you want to set manually your wallpaper but it does not
allow you to select a random one.

Nowadays, I grab most of my wallpapers from
[InterfaceLIFT][interfacelift].
