Session reuse is one of the most important mechanism to
[improve SSL performance][1]: by submitting an appropriate blob to the
server, a client is able to trigger an abbreviated handshake,
improving latency and computation time. There exists two distinct ways
to achieve session reuse: **session identifiers** as described in
[RFC 5246][rfc5246] and **session tickets** as depicted in
[RFC 5077][rfc5077].

[TOC]

A quick note: when I say **SSL**, unless I mention a version number,
you should read **TLS** instead. Look at the article for
[TLS on Wikipedia][tls] for some background on this.

# Theory of operation

To establish a SSL connection, four messages need to be exchanged
between client and server. With a latency of 50 ms, we have a 200 ms
overhead to establish the connection (plus TCP handshake). Moreover,
to share a common secret, both the client and the server needs to
achieve some public-key cryptographic operations which are costly,
computation-wise.

![SSL full handshake][s1]
[s1]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake.png]] "Full SSL handshake"

To avoid a full SSL handshake each time a client request a resource,
it is possible for the client to request an abbreviated handshake,
saving a complete round-trip (100 ms) and avoiding the costliest part
of the full SSL handshake.

![SSL abbreviated handshake][s2]
[s2]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/ssl-handshake-with-resume.png]] "Abbreviated SSL handshake"

Two mechanisms can be used to accomplish an abbreviated handshake:

1. When the server sends the "Server Hello" message, it can include a
   **session identifier**. The client should store it and present it
   in the "Client Hello" message of the next session. If the server
   finds the corresponding session in its cache and accepts to resume
   the session, it will send back the same session identifier and will
   continue with the abbreviated SSL handshake. Otherwise, it will
   issue a new session identifier and switch to a full handshake. This
   mechanism is detailed in [RFC 5246][rfc5246]. It is the most common
   mechanism because it exists since earlier versions of SSL.

2. In the last exchange of a full SSL handshake, the server can
   include a "New Session Ticket" message (not represented in the
   handshake described in the picture) which will contain the complete
   session state (including the master secret negotiated between the
   client and the server and the cipher suite used). Therefore, this
   state is encrypted and integrity-protected by a key known only by
   the server. This opaque datum is known as a **session ticket**. The
   details lie in [RFC 5077][rfc5077] which supersedes
   [RFC 4507][rfc4507].

The ticket mechanism is a TLS extension. The client can advertise its
support by sending an empty "Session Ticket" extension in the "Client
Hello" message. The server will answer with an empty "Session Ticket"
extension in its "Server Hello" message if it supports it. If one of
them does not support this extension, they can fallback to the session
identifier mechanism built into SSL.

[RFC 5077][rfc5077] identifies situations where tickets are desirable
over session identifiers. The main improvement is to avoid to maintain
a server-side session cache since the whole session state is
remembered by the client, not the server. A session cache can be
costly in term of memory and difficult to share between multiple hosts
when requests are load-balanced across servers.

# Browser support

Session identifiers are part of SSL and are therefore supported since
a long time by clients and servers. However, session tickets are an
optional TLS extension and therefore, the support is not as widespread
as for session identifiers. Support for tickets was added in
[OpenSSL][openssl] 0.9.8f (October 2007). In [GnuTLS][gnutls], this is
version 2.9.3 (August 2009). For [NSS][nss], the set of libraries
behind most browsers, support of RFC 5077 is in version 3.12 (June
2008). [Schannel][schannel], Microsoft implementation of TLS, does not
currently supports tickets.

To check if a browser supports session resume without and with
tickets, I have written a [web server][rfc5077-server] listening to
several ports with different configurations (session cache disabled or
enabled, ticket support disabled or enabled). With the help of some
Javascript, it is possible to interact with this server to determine
what kind of session resume a browser support.

![Checking for browser support for session resume][s3]
[s3]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-screenshot.png]] "Example of test with Chromium 14"

It is difficult to get extensive results this way since you need to
install a lot of browsers to get something valuable. Surprisingly,
Android 2.3.4 browser (as shipped by Cyanogen Mod) does not support
any session resume.

Another way to check if a browser supports session resume is to use a
sniffer and to spot "Client Hello" messages. If a client tries to
resume a session, it will use an appropriate session identifier or
send a ticket. A simple [program parsing PCAP files][rfc5077-pcap]
allows one to automate this task and get some interesting statistics. Here
are random facts from more than 300 000 requests (38 000 clients) to
a customer care service of an important French telco:

- 35% of requests exhibit support of tickets;
- 53.3% of requests ask to resume without tickets; 25.6% with tickets;
- 67.2% of requests exhibit support of [SNI][sni];
- 86.7% of requests use TLS 1.0; the remaining uses SSL 3.0; almost no TLS
  1.1/1.2;
- in average, a client execute 8 SSL handshakes;
- ciphers supported by all clients are 3DES-SHA, RC4-MD5 and RC4-SHA.

With some log analysis to match each requests with the appropriate
user agent, we can split the world in two parts: browsers supporting
RFC 5077 (Chrome and Firefox) and browsers not supporting RFC 5077
(Internet Explorer, Opera 9.80, Safari for MacOS and iOS and Android
browser).

# Web server support

There is no unique recipe to configure a web server to handle
appropriately and efficiently session resume. Here are some generic
directions :

- if the web server uses multiple processes, you need to configure a
  shared memory session cache; usually, tickets will work just fine in
  this setup;
- if you use local load-balancing, one easy way to avoid any problem
  is to use ensure that one IP is mapped to one server (either
  statically with hashing or dynamically with a stick table); if your
  load-balancer understands SSL, you can also use session identifier
  (and disable tickets[^1]) to build a stick
  table;
- if you don't want to apply the previous advice, you need to share
  the session cache between the servers with something like
  [memcached][memcached] and disable tickets;
- if you use global load-balancing (DNS based), there
  is no need to ensure that session resumption works across geographic
  pools since a user will usually stick to one pool.

[^1]: [RFC 5077][rfc5077] describes interactions between session
      identifiers and session tickets. When using tickets, the server
      *should* send back an empty session identifier. The client *may*
      present an empty session identifier or generate one. However,
      for all practical purposes, it seems that servers send back a
      non-empty session identifier and clients just stick to this
      identifier. Please, investigate if you want to use SSL session
      identifiers for load-balancing while keeping tickets enabled.

Remember that only one client out of three supports TLS
tickets. Therefore, you cannot rely on them to ensure proper session
resume. You need a session cache.

## Setting a session cache with Apache & nginx

**Apache** features two different SSL engines. The first one is
[mod_ssl][modssl] and uses OpenSSL as backend. It is possible to setup
a shared session cache with `SSLSessionCache` but the
memcached-enabled session cache is
[available only in the development branch][modssl-memcached]. You can
also get one by switching to [mod_gnutls][modgnutls] backend. The
cache is enabled with `GnuTLSCache`. In this case, do not enable
tickets because they cannot be shared.

With **nginx**, you need to enable the shared session cache with
`ssl_session_cache`. Currently, it lacks a memcached-enabled session
cache but [Matt Palmer has some patches to add it][nginxcaching] to
the 0.8 branch. However, those patches can have a serious impact on
nginx performance since retrieving a session from memcached is done
synchronously (mostly because a limitation in OpenSSL design who does
not allow us to register asynchronous callbacks with
`SSL_CTX_sess_set_get_cb()`).

As a proof of concept, I have also added a similar feature to
[**stud**][stud], the scalable TLS unwrapping daemon, a very efficient
network proxy terminating SSL connections. The same limitation as for
*nginx* applies: performances will suffer. Look at the
[pull request][pr] for more details.

## Sharing tickets

[RFC 5077][rfc5077] tells tickets allow us to load-balance requests
across servers. However, to the best of my knowledge, there is
currently no web server able to share tickets across a pool. Actually,
when a server initializes its SSL stack, it will randomly generate
some keys that will be used to protect and encrypt tickets. In
OpenSSL, from `ssl/ssl_lib.c`:

        ::c
        /* Setup RFC4507 ticket keys */
        if ((RAND_pseudo_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_key_name, 16) <= 0)
                || (RAND_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_hmac_key, 16) <= 0)
                || (RAND_bytes(ret->tlsext_tick_aes_key, 16) <= 0))
                ret->options |= SSL_OP_NO_TICKET;

Therefore, with a round-robin load-balanced pool of servers, tickets
have to be disabled because servers would not accept tickets from
neighbors. One way to solve this is to generate keys deterministically
by hashing some common secret with the private key. I have implemented
this approach for *stud*. Here is a simplified version (no error
handling, no allocation) of the [pull request for this feature][pr2]:

        ::c
        unsigned char keys[48];
        EVP_PKEY *pkey = grab_private_key();

        /* To get our key, we sign the seed with the private key */
        unsigned int siglen;
        unsigned char sign[LARGE_ENOUGH];
        EVP_MD_CTX mdctx;
        EVP_MD_CTX_init(&mdctx);
        EVP_SignInit(&mdctx, EVP_sha256());
        EVP_SignUpdate(&mdctx, some_secret, strlen(some_secret));
        EVP_SignFinal(&mdctx, sign, &siglen, pkey);

        /* And we keep only the first bytes. */
        memcpy(keys, sign, sizeof(keys));

        /* Tell OpenSSL to use those keys */
        SSL_CTX_set_tlsext_ticket_keys(ctx, keys, sizeof(keys));

[pr2]: https://github.com/bumptech/stud/pull/30

**UPDATED:** [Paul Querna](http://twitter.com/pquerna/) has added
[support for configuring keys protecting session tickets in Apache HTTPD][ticket-httpd].
This adds two new directives: `SSLTicketKeyFile` and
`SSLTicketKeyDefault`.

[ticket-httpd]: https://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1200040 "Commit 1200040 in Apache HTTPD SVN"

**UPDATED:** If you care about perfect forward secrecy like the one
provided by cipher suites like `DHE-RSA-AES128-SHA`, using tickets
this way will weaken it. Keys should be rotated in some synchronized
way.

## Testing

While tests can be done with just `openssl s_client` and `openssl
sess_id`, testing all aspects can take a lot of time. For this
purpose, I have written a
[client testing session resume with and without tickets][rfc5077-client]. Here
is a typical result:

![twitter.com RFC session resume][s4]
[s4]: [[!!images/benchs-ssl/rfc5077-twitter.png]] "Example of test with twitter.com"

The program will try to establish five consecutive SSL connections for
each IP without and with tickets. For each IP, the last four SSL
connections should always reuse the first SSL session. Here, Twitter
web servers seem properly configured: for each IP, session resume is
successful. Their web servers do not support tickets or they may have
disabled it because they share the session cache between servers
inside the same pool.
