This document explains how to set up a fully encrypted para-virtualized XEN instance. In this howto, the host system is running Debian Etch, while the guest system to be installed will be using Debian Lenny.
 

Introduction

If you are concerned about your privacy, you might want to consider using hard disk encryption to protect your valuable private data from spying eyes. Usually, the easiest way would be to use your distribution's installer to set up a fully encrypted system; I think most recent Linux distributions support this. However, when you are using XEN to provide virtualization, there are situations where you might not want to encrypt your whole computer with all guest instances, but instead only encrypt one OS instance. This howto will deal with exactly this situation. It assumes that the XEN host system is already up and running.

 

Preparing the XEN instance

Firstly, we need to create the XEN configuration for the new guest instance. This can easily be done with the script xen-create-image from the package xen-tools:

xen:~# aptitude install xen-tools

Now, we need to 'teach' xen-tools the existence of Lenny (since, remember, we're using Etch as the host system):

xen:~# ln -s /usr/lib/xen-tools/debian.d /usr/lib/xen-tools/lenny.d

Now, we can create the XEN instance:

xen:~# xen-create-image --memory 150M --size 1G --noswap --ip 10.0.0.1 --hostname crypto.example.com --dist lenny

This last step installs a very basic Debian Lenny guest system. We will use this system to configure encrypted filesystems and eventually copy its contents over to these encrypted filesystems.

The encrypted filesystem(s) of the new system will all be stored using LVM. So basically, this is kind of a 'LVM inside LVM': We need to create a logical volume on the host system which will be made available to the guest system as /dev/sdX, and inside the encrypted guest system, we will install LVM using this /dev/sdX as physical volume to store our volume group:

xen:~# lvcreate -L24G -n crypto.example.com_crypt vg0

Here we assume that the volume group on the XEN server, which holds the logical volumes of all the XEN instances is called vg0.

By default, xen-create-image creates a configuration file /etc/xen/crypto_unencrypted.cfg. We need to modify this to include the additional logical volume, so that it reads as follows:

kernel  = '/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64'
ramdisk = '/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64'
memory  = '150'
root    = '/dev/sda1'
disk    = [ 'phy:vg0/crypto.example.com_disk,sda1,w', 'phy:vg0/crypto.example.com_crypt,sda2,w' ]
name    = 'crypto.example.com'
vif  = [ 'ip=10.0.0.1' ]
on_poweroff = 'destroy'
on_reboot   = 'restart'
on_crash    = 'restart'
So now we're ready to first start into the newly created system:

xen:~# xm create -c /etc/xen/crypto_unencrypted.cfg

 

Preparatory steps inside the temporary XEN guest

After logging in, we need to install necessary components:

crypto:~# aptitude install lvm2 cryptsetup

Next, we fill the target partition with random data:

crypto:~# dd if=/dev/urandom of=/dev/sda2

Create the cryptodisk:

crypto:~# cryptsetup -c aes-cbc-essiv:sha256 -y -s256 luksFormat /dev/sda2

Enable LVM to handle cryptsetup devices. For this, add the following to the devices section of /etc/lvm/lvm.conf:

types = [ "device-mapper", 16 ]
Open the crypto device:

crypto:~# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sda2 crypt

Create the physical volume and the volume group for LVM:

crypto:~# pvcreate /dev/mapper/crypt
crypto:~# vgcreate vg-crypt /dev/mapper/crypt

Create logical volumes:

crypto:~# lvcreate -L1G -nroot vg-crypt
crypto:~# lvcreate -L2G -ntmp vg-crypt
crypto:~# lvcreate -L12G -nvar vg-crypt
crypto:~# lvcreate -L1G -nswap vg-crypt
crypto:~# lvcreate -L3G -nusr vg-crypt

Now, when creating the logical volumes, there is not exactly 1G of space left on the device but slightly more. We use vgdisplay to find out exactly how much space is left and then create the last volume:

crypto:~# lvcreate -l255 -nusrlocal vg-crypt

And create filesystems:

crypto:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/vg-crypt/root
crypto:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/vg-crypt/tmp
crypto:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/vg-crypt/usr
crypto:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/vg-crypt/usrlocal
crypto:~# mkfs.ext3 /dev/vg-crypt/var
crypto:~# mkswap /dev/vg-crypt/swap

You might ask yourself why I am creating so many filesystems? Well, this is supposed to become a pretty secure system (after all, otherwise, all the encryption does not help if my system is hacked), so later I will be following the advice of the Securing Debian Handbook (http://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/), which however is not covered in this howto.

Mount the newly created filesystems:

crypto:~# mkdir /mnt/target
crypto:~# mount /dev/vg-crypt/root /mnt/target/

crypto:~# mkdir /mnt/target/usr/local -p
crypto:~# mkdir /mnt/target/var
crypto:~# mkdir /mnt/target/tmp
crypto:~# mount /dev/vg-crypt/usr /mnt/target/usr
crypto:~# mount /dev/vg-crypt/usrlocal /mnt/target/usr/local
crypto:~# mount /dev/vg-crypt/var /mnt/target/var
crypto:~# mount /dev/vg-crypt/tmp /mnt/target/tmp

And copy the currently running filesystem to the encrypted ones:

crypto:~# init s
crypto:~# cp -apx / /target/

Since we copied the data from a running system, we need to clean up a bit:

crypto:~# /bin/rm -fr /target/tmp/*
crypto:~# /bin/rm -fr /target/proc/*
crypto:~# /bin/rm -fr /target/sys/*
crypto:~# /bin/rm /target/etc/mtab

Create the /target/etc/fstab:

proc                   /proc      proc     rw,nodev,nosuid,noexec 0     0
/dev/vg-crypt/root     /          ext3     errors=remount-ro      0     1
/dev/vg-crypt/usr      /usr       ext3     errors=remount-ro      0     1
/dev/vg-crypt/usrlocal /usr/local ext3     errors=remount-ro      0     1
/dev/vg-crypt/var      /var       ext3     errors=remount-ro      0     1
/dev/vg-crypt/tmp      /tmp       ext3     errors=remount-ro      0     1
/dev/vg-crypt/swap     none       swap     sw                     0     0
As stated above, here you might want to consider the Securing Debian Handbook and apply some additional security tweaks.

For now, stop the guest system:

crypto:~# halt

 

Back in the XEN Host-System ...

We need to install some necessary tools:

xen:~# aptitude install cryptsetup initramfs-tools

Now we create a XEN configuration file /etc/xen/crypto_encrypted.cfg for the encrypted system:

kernel  = '/boot/vmlinuz-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64'
ramdisk = '/boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64_crypt'
memory  = '150'
root    = '/dev/mapper/vg--crypt-root'
disk    = [ 'phy:vg0/crypto.example.com_crypt,sda1,w' ]
name    = 'crypto.example.com'
vif  = [ 'ip=10.0.0.1' ]
on_poweroff = 'destroy'
on_reboot   = 'restart'
on_crash    = 'restart'
Now comes the really tricky part about this. We need to create a new initrd image so that the encrypted system actually asks for the disks Key.

First, we create a file /etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/cryptroot:

CRYPTROOT=target=crypt,source=/dev/sda1,key=none,lvm=vg--crypt-root
Note that even though the volume group which holds the encrypted filesystems is called vg-crypt, we need to 'escape' the '-' with a second dash.

Then, we add the following lines to the file /etc/initramfs-tools/modules:

aes-x86_64
dm-crypt
dm-mod
sha256
Next, we backup our existing initrd image, create a new one and do some renaming:

xen:~# mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64 /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64_orig
xen:~# update-initramfs -k 2.6.18-6-xen-amd64 -v -c
xen:~# mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64 /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64_crypt
xen:~# mv /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64_orig /boot/initrd.img-2.6.18-6-xen-amd64

So now we are ready to start the encrypted XEN guest:

xen:~# xm create -c /etc/xen/crypto_encrypted.cfg

If all went well, you will be prompted for the Key to the encrypted volume, and the whole systems boots. Enjoy :)

Now you can still clean up a bit:

xen:~# /bin/rm /etc/xen/crypto_unencrypted.cfg
xen:~# lvremove /dev/vg0/crypto.example.com_disk

One important thing: YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRUST THE HOST SYSTEM!!! If the host system is compromised, it might log the console input when you enter the Key for unlocking the cryptsetup device, thus learning the password whith which you encrypted all your data!!!
