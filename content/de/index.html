I am Vincent Bernat and I live in Paris. I am a fond user of GNU/Linux
since 1999. I am involved in [various free projects][projects],
essentially written in C or Python. I happen to be a
[Debian Developer][debian]. I am also some kind of network
expert. This website is mostly my [blog][blog], which content is
usually technical.
