=========================

This is the source code of my website.
Sometime in the future, you can find the result at <http://andreas-h.info>.
I am using [Hyde][hyde], a static website generator written in Python.

Feel free to look at how things are done.
Both content (all HTML and image files) and boilerplate (CSS, JS, layout) are licensed as [CC BY-NC-SA 3.0][cc], unless I am not the author of the work (for example, jQuery, ModernizR, fonts).

This website is based on the website of [Vincent Bernat][vincentbernat].
So far, I have not changed the templates/css of[Vincent][vincentbernat]'s original, so many of the things in this repo come from him.

Also, please note that at the moment, this website is not online yet.
